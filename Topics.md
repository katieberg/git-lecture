### What is Version Control?
* managing changes to source code over time

### Why is it important?
* whiteboard w/resume

### Why Git, specifically?
    * distributed, not centralized - can have local histories w/o internet conn
    * branching workflow for agile development

### Setting Up Your Own Repos
* ignoring files
* initializing repo
* `git status`
* adding files
* commiting changes
* `git log`
* pushing to github

### Activity: Collaboration with Git
    Clone the Repo I just created. DO NOT FORK IT. 

    In the students folder, create a new file called `{YOUR_FIRST_NAME}.txt`. Inside of it, write your last name and save it. Then add, commit, and push your changes. Once everyone has pushed, we will talk about how to pull down other team members' changes.

### BONUS:
